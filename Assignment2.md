Krecipes

Krecipes is an open source recipe manager that provides the user with many helpful cooking related features in addition to just recipe storage such as creating a shopping list and meal planning with a diet helper that is linked to the USDA database which provides nutritional facts. The program is fairly long standing and originated in 2003.

According to Sourceforge.net, there were 21 downloads of the program this week.  Krecipes currently does not have an actual website, just a Sourceforge page that gives a brief overview and information regarding the program such as a change log, a handbook, download information and the program authors’ contact information.  There have been many updates and enhancements to the code over time. The program is written in C++ and the files are very accessible for any programmers that would like to contribute to Krecipes.

Krecipes is kept very current and the software was updated as recently as February 2014.  The authors have recently developed support for new databases outside of those the original program supported such as SQLite and PostgreSQL.  The software is maintained constantly to keep the product to keep as efficient and useful as possible. 

Krecipes’ documentation is thorough; there is a handbook with detailed instructions on how to use the various functions of the program.  The user can search and edit recipes, importing and exporting recipes from a variety of sources using several different file types and also manage site preferences.  The handbook also offers directions on how to report bugs and detailed breakdown of the functionality of all menu items within the program.

Among the files available for download is a comprehensive README file that explains numerous functions on how to run the program, how to access the code and how to make modifications.

Krecipes was developed using KDE, a platform used to build open source applications.
KDE has an easy to navigate user interface with many helpful ways to organize and categorize information.  KDE provides advanced graphical desktop features and offers applications for a wide variety of developer needs.

Krecipes has extremely positive reviews. Users enjoy program and find it to be a valuable resource and addition to their software collection.  Many posts referencing Krecipes show that users are very excited about the program and consider it to be a vital addition to their open source arsenal of programs.

On the downside, it is not easy to install actual program. If the user doesn’t have more than average computer and software knowledge and are unfamiliar with GIT, they will have a very difficult time trying to get the program loaded on a computer.  The KDE system must be installed on the user’s system as well as some additional minor software applications. Krecipes is not for the casual, everyday computer user.  Due to this, there is a very limited scope of consumers that will be attracted to the program and due to technical nature of program itself those will only be tech savvy consumers.


Crop Planning Software

Crop Planning Software (“CPS”) is a program developed to assist gardeners with managing and planning their gardens each growing season.  CPS has robust functionality and can be a helpful tool even for small farmers. 

Program users have a way to quickly organize gardening and planting plans as well as sort and filter their input information, copy from other plans they have previously input or have CPS make calculations on planting based on data entered.

The program is widely available to many computer users; there are Windows, Mac and Unix versions of the software.  The Java based program does not have its own website.  The code and installation software are easily accessed through Sourceforge.net and code.google.com.

CPS can be easily utilized by computer users of all experience levels.  The installation wizard is accessed simply by opening the executable file and after only a few easy steps, the program is ready to be used.  Getting the full program up and running is an exceptionally quick process. The user interface design has a very simple layout and is easy to navigate.  The user is at times prompted for a few data points, and the directions are clear, concise and straight forward.

The program only had two downloads through SourceForge this week; it is not as popular or as widely used as other open source applications and has a more limited audience base.  The software is kept current and was most recently updated in February of 2014.  All files are easily accessible for developer use.  However there have been only a few versions since the program was created in 2012 which might signal that there is not much developer interest.

The software’s documentation is fairly adequate.  The program authors have provided easy steps on how to use the program and how to provide them with any constructive feedback on how to improve the program in future versions.  There are screen shots of how to make use of various functions within the program as well as basic troubleshooting FAQ’s, set up and installation instructions and ongoing release notes of changes occurring in each new version of the program. There is also information detailing the assistance needed to continue to update and develop the program and the ways programmers can contribute to the project through testing, coding, documentation, art and graphics or web maintenance.  Users also have the ability to financially support the project and make a donation directly to CPS. 

The one area in which CPS is most lacking is in the aesthetics of the program.  While it is easily used by even a very inexperienced computer user, the program could incorporate more attractive graphics and be more visually appealing. 

CPS is very exciting for gardeners of all experience levels and can make the planning steps of gardening quick and stress free.  Since gardening to this extent is a bit of a niche hobby, the user-ship may never be extremely robust and reviews or mentions on blogs are quite hard to find.
 
 
fsTimer

fsTimer is a software program for timing races. fsTimer is an ideal solution for a small group or charity that would like to put on a race but don’t have the means for professional chip timing.  The program includes functionality for registration, timing each participant and recording and printing results.

The program is versatile and will run on any Mac, Windows or Linux based laptop.  fsTimer allows the race organizers to easily handle a big group; multiple computers can take in information which can be combined onto one system and pre-registration can easily be imported from a spreadsheet.  A simple USB barcode scanner finalizes runners’ time at the finish line.  

fsTimer is a Python based program produced by a group at MIT. It has its own full website which clearly explains the purpose of the program.  The website is attractive and easy to use and provides instructions on how to download the program directly through the site.  The program authors also thoroughly cover how to print out barcodes to be used by each participant in the race.  

fsTimer has a section filled with clear and easy to understand documentation covering installation and each step of the program from registration to timing as well as several screen shots that explain the difference functions available.  There is a documentation section especially for developers to help explain the code.   The change log breaks down each version and actually explains the new enhancements. The project originated in 2012 and a new version was released in March of 2014.  The authors also mention that they intend to provide another update in the fall of 2014.

It is difficult to gauge the interest level from developers and users as the site doesn’t have a section for user reviews and none have been found on other sites.  However the source code is easily found on the website for those who are interested in making enhancements.  fsTimer fills a very specific, larger scale need and is not something a person or group would use every day.  The potential for growth and gaining new users is fairly limited due to this.  

fsTimer does require some basic knowledge of programming on the part of the user. A user must have python and PyGTK installed in order for fsTimer to function.  However, those with patience but not much computer skill could still make use of fsTimer as the site does carefully explain how to get through the set up processes of needed software.  Once installed, the program is quick and simple to use and actions are broken out into four categories: preregister, register, compile and time.  This makes race-day use of the program uncomplicated for any volunteers who may need to briefly have access to the program.  While useful, the program is somewhat bland and could use some additional interesting design features. A helpful enhancement for this program could be to directly upload the results to an organization’s website so runners can look up their time after the race has ended.
